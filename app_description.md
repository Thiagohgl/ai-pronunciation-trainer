# AI Pronunciation Trainer

See [my fork](https://github.com/trincadev/ai-pronunciation-trainer) of [AI Pronunciation Trainer](https://github.com/Thiagohgl/ai-pronunciation-trainer) repository
for more details.

Right now this tool uses [{model_name}]({model_url}) as STT (speech-to-text) model and {sample_rate_start} as sample rate value (from empirical tests the best sample rate value is 48000).
