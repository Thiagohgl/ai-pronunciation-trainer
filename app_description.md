## Models and variables 

Right now this tool uses:

- [{model_name}]({model_url}) as STT (speech-to-text) model; other supported models are:
{models_names_urls_list}
- <u>{sample_rate_start}</u> as input samplerate value (from empirical tests the best sample rate value is 48000)
- <u>{sample_rate_resample}</u> as resampled samplerate value
- <u>{samplerate_tts}</u> as TTS (text-to-speech) samplerate value
