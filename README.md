# Ai Pronunciation Trainer 
This tool uses AI to evaluate your pronunciation so you can improve it and be understood more clearly. You can go straight test the tool at https://aipronunciationtr.com (please use the chrome browser for desktop and have some patience for it to "warm-up" :) ). 

## Installation 
To run the program locally, you need to install the requirements and run the main python file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python webApp.py
```
You'all also need ffmpeg, which you can download from here https://ffmpeg.org/download.html. On Windows, it may be needed to add the ffmpeg "bin" folder to your PATH environment variable. On Mac, you can also just run "brew install ffmpeg".

You should be able to run it locally without any major issues as long as you’re using a recent python 3.X version.  

## Online version
For the people who don’t feel comfortable running code or just want to have a quick way to use the tool, I hosted an online version of it at https://aipronunciationtr.com. It should work well in desktop-chrome, any other browser is not officially supported, although most of the functionality should work fine. 
 
Please be aware that the usage is limited by day (I’m still not rich ;)). If, for some reason, you would like to avoid the daily usage limit, just enter in contact and we see what we can do. 

## Motivation

Often, when we want to improve our pronunciation, it is very difficult to self-assess how good we’re speaking. Asking a native, or language instructor, to constantly correct us is either impractical, due to monetary constrains, or annoying due to simply being too boring for this other person. Additionally, they may often say “it sounds okay” after your 10th try to not discourage you, even though you may still have some mistakes in your pronunciation. 

The AI pronunciation trainer is a way to provide objective feedback on how well your pronunciation is in an automatic and scalable fashion, so the only limit to your improvement is your own dedication. 

This project originated from a small program that I did to improve my own pronunciation.  When I finished it, I believed it could be a useful tool also for other people trying to be better understood, so I decided to make a simple, more user-friendly version of it. 

## Disclaimer 
This is a simple project that I made in my free time with the goal to be useful to some people. It is not perfect, thus be aware that some small bugs may be present. In case you find something is not working, all feedback is welcome, and issues may be addressed depending on their severity.
